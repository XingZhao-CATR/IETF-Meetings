## Detailed Agenda

### 1. Agenda Bashing & Introduction (Chairs) (10 min)

### 2. Part 1: Operators Inputs  (60 min)

Operators presenting their problems and views, in the context of network anomaly.

#### 2.1. Swisscom: Network Incident Network Analytics Postmortem (20 min)
 
* Presenter: Thomas Graf
* Reading Material: Describes incidents in terms of what happened, which operational metrics where available, which analytical metrics described the symptoms and what improvements in the network anomaly detection system and network telemetry protocols are proposed.
 
#### 2.2. Bell Canada: Network Incident Network Analytics Postmortem (10 min)
 
* Presenter: Dan Voyer
* Reading Material: Describes incidents in terms of what happened and give insights on the current network telemetry rollout in the network and their preparation for anomaly detection deployment.
 
#### 2.3. Orange: Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Cross-Operator Incident Management and Network Design (15 min)

* Presenter: Lionel Tailhardat
* Reading Material: [draft-tailhardat-nmop-incident-management-noria](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tailhardat-nmop-incident-management-noria/)
  
#### 2.4. INSA: Practical Anomaly Detection in Internet Services: An ISP centric approach (15 min)

* Presenter: Alex Huang Feng

### 3. Part 2: NMOP Plan of Work   (50 min)

_Presenters Guidelines and Presentation Objectives_:

 - Don't repeat what was presented at the last IETF meeting
 - Please focus on:
        - Open issues (favor the discussion, plan the Q&A in your timeslot)
        - Items that are meant to ease structuring the effort
        - Future plans
        - Experiments explanation, including how to interconnect with other experiments
   
#### 3.1. An Architecture for a Network Anomaly Detection Framework (15 min)
 
* Presenters: Wanting Du, Pierre Francois
* Reading Material: [draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture/)
 
#### 3.2. Experiment: Network Anomaly Lifecycle (20 min)
 
* Presenters: Vincenzo Riccobene
* Reading Material: [draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle/)

#### 3.3. Discussion, Open Issues, & Next Steps (15 min)

* WG Chairs lead discussion
