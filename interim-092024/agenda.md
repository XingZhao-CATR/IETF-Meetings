## Detailed Agenda

### 1. Agenda Bashing & Introduction (Chairs) (10 min)

### Part 1: Operators Input

Operators presenting their problems, in the context of network anomaly.

#### Swisscom: Network Incident Network Analytics Postmortem
 
* Presenter: Thomas Graf
* Duration: 20 min
* Reading Material: Describes incidents in terms of what happened, which operational metrics where available, which analytical metrics described the symptoms and what improvements in the network anomaly detection system and network telemetry protocols are proposed.
 
#### Bell Canada: Network Incident Network Analytics Postmortem
 
* Presenter: Dan Voyer
* Duration: 10 min
* Reading Material: Describes incidents in terms of what happened and give insights on the current network telemetry rollout in the network and their preparation for anomaly detection deployment.
 
#### Orange: Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Cross-Operator Incident Management and Network Design

* Presenter: Lionel Tailhardat
* Duration: 15 min
* Reading Material: draft-tailhardat-nmop-incident-management-noria
  
#### INSA: Practical Anomaly Detection in Internet Services: An ISP centric approach

* Presenter: Alex Huang Feng
* Duration: 15 min
* Reading Material: https://hal.science/hal-04655324 ; https://hal.science/hal-04307611

### Part 2: NMOP Plan of Work

Presenters Guidelines and Presentation Objectives:
 - don't repeat what was presented at the last IETF
 - focus on:
        - open issues (favor the discussion, plan the Q&A in your timeslot)
        - items that ease structuring the effort
        - future plans
        - experiment explanation, including how to interconnect with other experiments
   
#### An Architecture for a Network Anomaly Detection Framework
 
* Presenters: Wanting Du, Pierre Francois
* Duration: 15 min
* Reading Material: [draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture/)
 
#### Experiment: Network Anomaly Lifecycle
 
* Presenters: Vincenzo Riccobene
* Duration: 20 min
* Reading Material: [draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle/)

#### Discussion, Open Issues, Next Steps

* WG chairs lead discussion
