Please find below a drafty draft proposal for the agenda:

1.	Introduction (Chairs, 5 min)
2.	Digital Map Concept and terminology (Olga, 15 min) 
o	Discuss issues related to the concept definition, applicability, etc.
3.	Review and discussion of the Digital Map requirements (Olga/all, 60 min) 
o	Detailed presentation/discussion of each requirement (one slide, one requirement) with the goal to agree on a stable set of requirements
4.	Digital Map Assessment Plans (30 min) 
o	RFC 8345-based approach: Updates (Olga)
o	RFC8795 assessment/experiment plan (Italo ?)
5.	Next Steps (all, 10 min)

We would like to consolidate the requirements, agree on their meaning/purpose, avoid biased ones, etc. so that assessment work can have a stable base for analysis. Item (3) is thus key for the success of the meeting.
